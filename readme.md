This is a tracker of my JS learning progress with [Ethan Brown's](https://github.com/EthanRBrown) &#39;Learning JavaScript 3rd edition&#39; During the read, I put the code examples from each book chapter into respective repository folders. Short notes, new vocabulary and other noteworthy pieces of information were stored in this file. I hope you find these useful.

> ‚òù **NOTE: You should never rely on someone else's notes and read this book on your own. But it might be a good idea to check underwritten bullets to find something you are yet unfamiliar with.**

## Chapter1
1.  JavaScript is not Java. It is a realization of the ECMAScript language.
ECMAScript 6 (ES6) was published in June 2015 and was also referenced as "Harmony", "ES2015" or "ECMAScript2015".
2.  ES6 is basically syntax sugar over ES5 which really had a lot of changes over the previous standard. Nevertheless, ES6 features help coder a lot and fix several issues present in language earlier.
3.  'use strict' directive is not a command, nor a function or an object. It is just a string that tells your browser to slightly change its behavior while parsing and running the code. It does not 'switch on' the ES6 syntax.
4.  You can use a transpiler to automatically convert your ES6 code to older syntax if you need it for compatibility reasons.
5.  This book was not created to cover all aspects of ES6 in detail, some other good references are `Mozilla Developer Network`, or `JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan` (it does not cover ES6 now, but as for May 2019 some chapters of the new revision are available on Amazon as early access).
6.  Choose a good code editor to support you during the way. Most of the modern editors go with some useful features like syntax highlighting, words autocompletion and more.
7.  Before you know what you are doing be extremely attentive to each symbol you type from the source. You will definitely waste half an hour one day because of one wrong semicolon.
8.  Put your CSS in the header 
    `<link  rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">`
Put your scripts to the end of the body by default. There are several reasons for this, that will be discussed later
    `<script  src="main. js"></script>`
9.  Open dev tools with F12 in most of the browsers. If you go to console then, use `<Ctrl+Shift+K>` to shorten the way.
10. CDNs aka content delivery networks is an easy way to include public JS libraries to your project. We will use jQuery and PaperJS in this chapter's example. Yes, jQuery is as old as you, but it is still commonly used and a lot of tools are based on it. 
11. Boilerplate is just a repetitive standard piece of code that you use to set up things like PaperJS or other external libraries.
12.  Asynchronous events are the ones that happen without your control. The user decides to click, or external script finishes work - you never know **exactly** when the event happens. As easy as that.
